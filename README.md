# Node_Tutorial

I learn by building projects and I'm attempting John Smilga's 4 NodeJS projects course on YouTube - [link](https://youtu.be/qwfE7fSVaZM?si=vEcZKr80lmxN0RJi) alongside some side projects using Node's built-in http module for REST-API.

I now understand the things I've been seeing about NOdeJS.
